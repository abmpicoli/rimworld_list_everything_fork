# RimWorld-ListEverything

This is a permanent fork of the mod https://github.com/alextd/RimWorld-ListEverything

I decided to make this an "independent" repository because I have received some 
questions in private regarding issues compiling this mod, and I didn't want to 
place this discussion in a repository that would get other people being "bugged" with
the questions. 

List everything on the map with various filters.

Compilation hints:

1) Follow the typical configuration for mods, as discussed in the wiki 
https://rimworldwiki.com/wiki/Modding_Tutorials/Setting_up_a_solution 

The most important of all is the fact that *if you don't place the repository inside the rimworld Mods directory, references to required libraries will break*.
