# RimWorld-ListEverything: Slightly Improved.

This is a permanent fork of the mod https://github.com/alextd/RimWorld-ListEverything

I decided to make this an "independent" repository because I have received some 
questions in private regarding issues compiling this mod, and I didn't want to 
place this discussion in a repository that would get other people being "bugged" with
the questions. 

#Description:

List all sort of "things" on the map with various filters.

* When running a Rimworld game, click on the "Find" tab and there are many search options available. Some examples: 
* The "Search Spot" ![Search Spot Icon](Textures/find_center.png) construction option is made available in the Rimworld Architect "Misc" tab.
  If one or more Search Spots are set, then the search results will be ordered by distance from the closest spots.

# Compilation hints:

1) Follow the typical configuration for mods, as discussed in the wiki 
https://rimworldwiki.com/wiki/Modding_Tutorials/Setting_up_a_solution 

The most important of all is the fact that *if you don't place the repository inside the rimworld Mods directory, references to required libraries will break*.
