	<description>This is the ListEverything mod from Uuuggggh with a small improvement:
	
	As with the original, a new Find tab is made available at the bottom of the screen. 
	This allow to search for things on the map, with many criteria.
	
	(The improvement): The "MISC" Architect Tab now has a 'Search Spot'. You can place as many as you want in the map.
	If you place one or more of those, the list results will be ordered by "aproximate distance from the Search Spots", followed by the item name.
